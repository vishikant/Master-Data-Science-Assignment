    "### **Q1. What Are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How Are They Related to the Eigen-Decomposition Approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** are key concepts in linear algebra. Given a square matrix \\(A\\), an eigenvector \\(v\\) is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by \\(A\\), results in a scaled version of \\(v\\). The scalar by which it is scaled is called the **eigenvalue** \\( \\lambda \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this is represented as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A \\cdot v = \\lambda \\cdot v\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(A\\) is a square matrix,\n",
    "- \\(v\\) is an eigenvector,\n",
    "- \\( \\lambda \\) is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Eigen-Decomposition** approach is a method of factorizing a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. For a matrix \\(A\\), the eigen-decomposition is given by:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = V \\Lambda V^{-1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(V\\) is the matrix of eigenvectors,\n",
    "- \\( \\Lambda \\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues,\n",
    "- \\( V^{-1} \\) is the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "For the matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\), we solve the equation \\( A \\cdot v = \\lambda \\cdot v \\) to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",

    "### **Q2. What is Eigen-Decomposition and What is Its Significance in Linear Algebra?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigen-decomposition** is a process of factorizing a square matrix into a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Mathematically, for a matrix \\( A \\), eigen-decomposition is written as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = V \\Lambda V^{-1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(V\\) is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of \\(A\\),\n",
    "- \\( \\Lambda \\) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \\(A\\),\n",
    "- \\( V^{-1} \\) is the inverse of the matrix \\(V\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of eigen-decomposition lies in simplifying complex operations, such as matrix exponentiation, inversion, or diagonalization, by converting the matrix into a form that is easier to work with.\n",

    "### **Q3. What Are the Conditions for a Square Matrix to Be Diagonalizable Using the Eigen-Decomposition Approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A square matrix \\(A\\) is **diagonalizable** if there exists a matrix \\(V\\) of eigenvectors such that:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = V \\Lambda V^{-1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conditions for Diagonalization:**\n",
    "1. \\(A\\) must have **n linearly independent eigenvectors**, where \\(n\\) is the size of the matrix.\n",
    "2. If all the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are distinct, then \\(A\\) is guaranteed to be diagonalizable.\n",
    "3. If \\(A\\) has repeated eigenvalues, it can still be diagonalizable, but the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue (number of independent eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue) must equal its algebraic multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Proof:**\n",
    "If \\(A\\) has \\(n\\) linearly independent eigenvectors, we can construct the matrix \\(V\\) where the columns are these eigenvectors. The eigenvalue equation \\( A \\cdot v = \\lambda \\cdot v \\) can be written for all eigenvectors, resulting in \\( A = V \\Lambda V^{-1} \\).\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Q4. What is the Significance of the Spectral Theorem in the Context of the Eigen-Decomposition Approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Spectral Theorem** states that any real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix, i.e., a matrix \\(A\\) can be decomposed as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = Q \\Lambda Q^T\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(A\\) is a real symmetric matrix,\n",
    "- \\(Q\\) is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of \\(A\\),\n",
    "- \\( \\Lambda \\) is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of \\(A\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is significant because it guarantees that real symmetric matrices can be diagonalized in a way that preserves the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors. It also implies that the matrix can be decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, making computations such as matrix inversion and exponentiation easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "For the matrix \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\), the spectral theorem guarantees that it can be diagonalized.\n",

    "\\[\n",
    "\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0\n",

    "\n",
    "Geometrically:\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors** are directions in the vector space that are unchanged by the transformation represented by the matrix \\(A\\).\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues** represent the scaling factor by which vectors along these directions are stretched or compressed.\n",
    "\n",
