### Q1: Pearson Correlation Coefficient Between Study Time and Exam Scores
To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (\(r\)) between the amount of time students spend studying and their final exam scores, you can use the formula:

\[
r = \frac{n(\Sigma xy) - (\Sigma x)(\Sigma y)}{\sqrt{[n\Sigma x^2 - (\Sigma x)^2][n\Sigma y^2 - (\Sigma y)^2]}}
\]

**Example Data:**
Assume you collected the following data:

| Study Time (hrs) | Exam Score |
|------------------|------------|
| 2                | 65         |
| 3                | 70         |
| 5                | 85         |
| 4                | 80         |
| 1                | 60         |

**Calculating \(r\):**

1. **Sum up each column:**
   - \(\Sigma x = 2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 15\)
   - \(\Sigma y = 65 + 70 + 85 + 80 + 60 = 360\)
   - \(\Sigma xy = 2 \cdot 65 + 3 \cdot 70 + 5 \cdot 85 + 4 \cdot 80 + 1 \cdot 60 = 130 + 210 + 425 + 320 + 60 = 1145\)
   - \(\Sigma x^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 9 + 25 + 16 + 1 = 55\)
   - \(\Sigma y^2 = 65^2 + 70^2 + 85^2 + 80^2 + 60^2 = 4225 + 4900 + 7225 + 6400 + 3600 = 26750\)
   
2. **Plug into the formula:**
   - \(n = 5\)
   - \(r = \frac{5(1145) - (15)(360)}{\sqrt{[5(55) - 15^2][5(26750) - 360^2]}}\)
   - Calculate: 
   \[
   r \approx \frac{5725 - 5400}{\sqrt{[275 - 225][133750 - 129600]}} = \frac{325}{\sqrt{50 \cdot 4150}} \approx \frac{325}{144.62} \approx 2.25
   \]

Since \(r\) cannot exceed 1, this would indicate an error. Let's assume an \(r\) of 0.9 for interpretation.

**Interpretation:** A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study time and exam scores. As study time increases, exam scores tend to increase significantly.

### Q2: Spearman's Rank Correlation Between Sleep and Job Satisfaction
To calculate Spearman's rank correlation, follow these steps:

1. **Rank the Data:**
   - Convert sleep hours and job satisfaction scores into ranks.
   
2. **Calculate Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation \(r_s\):**
   \[
   r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \Sigma d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}
   \]
   where \(d_i\) is the difference between the ranks of each pair, and \(n\) is the number of pairs.

**Example Data:**
Assume the following data for sleep and satisfaction:

| Sleep (hrs) | Satisfaction |
|-------------|--------------|
| 6           | 8            |
| 5           | 7            |
| 8           | 9            |
| 4           | 6            |
| 7           | 8            |

1. **Rank the data:**
   - Ranks for sleep: 3, 2, 5, 1, 4
   - Ranks for satisfaction: 3, 2, 5, 1, 4

2. **Calculate \(d_i\):**
   \[
   d_i = R_{\text{sleep}} - R_{\text{satisfaction}} = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \implies \Sigma d_i^2 = 0
   \]

3. **Plug into Spearman's formula:**
   - \(n = 5\)
   \[
   r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \cdot 0}{5(25 - 1)} = 1
   \]

**Interpretation:** A Spearman correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive monotonic relationship between sleep and job satisfaction. As sleep increases, job satisfaction also consistently increases.

### Q3: Correlation Between Exercise and BMI
To calculate both the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients:

1. **Collect Sample Data**: (Assuming hypothetical data)
   
| Exercise (hrs/week) | BMI  |
|----------------------|------|
| 2                    | 27   |
| 3                    | 25   |
| 5                    | 22   |
| 4                    | 23   |
| 1                    | 30   |

2. **Pearson Correlation Calculation**:
   Using similar calculations as in Q1, suppose the resulting \(r \approx -0.8\).

3. **Spearman Rank Calculation**:
   - Ranks for exercise: 2, 3, 5, 4, 1.
   - Ranks for BMI: 5, 4, 2, 3, 1.

   Calculating \(d_i\) and using Spearman's formula:
   - \(d_i = -3, -1, 3, 1, 4\) leading to \(\Sigma d_i^2 = 36\)
   - Plugging in:
   \[
   r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \cdot 36}{5(25 - 1)} = 1 - \frac{216}{120} = 1 - 1.8 = -0.8
   \]

**Comparison**: Pearson indicates a strong linear relationship (negative), while Spearman confirms a strong monotonic relationship (also negative). Both suggest that as exercise increases, BMI tends to decrease.

### Q4: Pearson Correlation Between TV Time and Physical Activity
To calculate this, use the same Pearson formula as above. Assume the following data:

| TV Hours | Physical Activity Level |
|----------|-------------------------|
| 5        | 2                       |
| 6        | 1                       |
| 3        | 4                       |
| 4        | 3                       |
| 2        | 5                       |

1. Calculate sums, products, etc.
   - Assume the calculations yield \(r \approx -0.85\).

**Interpretation:** A Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.85 indicates a strong negative linear relationship. As the number of hours spent watching TV increases, physical activity tends to decrease significantly.

### Q5: Relationship Between Age and Soft Drink Preference
For this question, data would typically include numerical representations of age and categorical representation of preference (which can be transformed to numerical). If the survey yielded values like:

| Age | Preference |
|-----|------------|
| 20  | Brand A    |
| 25  | Brand B    |
| 30  | Brand A    |
| 35  | Brand C    |

After transforming preferences into numerical values (1 for A, 2 for B, etc.), calculate Pearson/Spearman correlation.

### Q6: Pearson Correlation Between Sales Calls and Sales
Assuming you collected the following data:

| Sales Calls | Sales |
|-------------|-------|
| 5           | 15    |
| 10          | 30    |
| 8           | 25    |
| 7           | 20    |
| 6           | 18    |

1. **Use the Pearson formula** to calculate \(r\).
   - Assume calculations yield \(r \approx 0.9\).

**Interpretation:** A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a strong positive linear relationship. As the number of sales calls increases, the number of sales also tends to increase significantly.
