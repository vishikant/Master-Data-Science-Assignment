    "### Advantages of K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity and Speed**:\n",
    "   - K-means is straightforward to understand and implement. It's computationally efficient, especially for large datasets, making it one of the fastest clustering algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - It scales well with the number of data points, performing efficiently on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "   - The results of K-means clustering are easy to interpret, with each cluster represented by its centroid, making it clear which data points belong to which cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Suitability for Well-Separated Clusters**:\n",
    "   - Works well when clusters are spherical and roughly equal in size, making it a good choice for simple clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Number of Clusters**:\n",
    "   - The user must predefine the number of clusters (*K*), which can be difficult if the appropriate number is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to Initial Centroids**:\n",
    "   - The final clusters can vary depending on the initial placement of centroids, potentially leading to suboptimal results. Multiple runs are often needed to find the best outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumption of Spherical Clusters**:\n",
    "   - K-means assumes clusters are spherical and evenly distributed, making it less effective for irregularly shaped or overlapping clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sensitive to Outliers**:\n",
    "   - Outliers can heavily influence the placement of centroids, leading to distorted clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Difficulty with Varying Densities**:\n",
    "   - Struggles with clusters of varying densities and sizes, where other algorithms like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering may perform better."

    "5. Cluster Visualization:\n",
    "Visual tools like scatter plots, 2D/3D projections, or cluster heatmaps can help in understanding the spatial arrangement of clusters.\n",
