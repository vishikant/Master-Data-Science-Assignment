    "#Q1. What is meant by time-dependent seasonal components?\n",
    "**Time-dependent seasonal components** refer to seasonal patterns in time series data that change over time, rather than remaining constant. \n",
    "Unlike fixed seasonality, where patterns repeat consistently (e.g., sales always spike every December), time-dependent seasonality evolves,\n",
    "showing variations in magnitude, frequency, or timing across different periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components can be influenced by factors like changing consumer behavior, economic conditions, or external events, leading to shifts in\n",
    "how the seasonal patterns manifest. For instance, a retail store might experience increasing holiday sales peaks year-over-year due to rising\n",
    "popularity of online shopping.\n",

    "#Q2. How can time-dependent seasonal components be identified in time series data?\n",
    "Identifying time-dependent seasonal components in time series data involves examining changes in seasonal patterns over time. Here are some key methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual Inspection**: Plotting the data and using seasonal decomposition techniques (e.g., STL decomposition) can help visually identify whether the amplitude, frequency, or phase of seasonality changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rolling Statistics**: Calculating rolling means and variances can highlight shifts in seasonal behavior, indicating evolving patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heatmaps or Seasonal Plots**: Plotting data in a calendar format or using heatmaps can reveal changes in seasonal intensity or timing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Examining ACF and PACF plots over different periods can show how seasonal lags change, suggesting time-dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fourier and Wavelet Analysis**: These methods detect changes in the frequency and amplitude of seasonality, capturing complex, evolving patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Machine Learning Techniques**: Methods like time-varying coefficient models or neural networks can automatically detect and adjust for changing seasonality. "

    "3. **External Events**: Unpredictable events like pandemics, natural disasters, or political changes can disrupt established seasonal patterns, making them time-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Marketing and Promotions**: Changes in promotional strategies, product launches, or advertising campaigns can temporarily enhance or dampen seasonal effects.\n",

    "5. **Competition**: New market entrants or changes in competitor behavior can influence seasonal sales or customer preferences, altering established patterns.\n",
