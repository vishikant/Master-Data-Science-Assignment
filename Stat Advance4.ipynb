    "The t-test and z-test are both statistical tests used to compare means, but they differ in their assumptions and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample Size:\n",
    "   - t-test: Typically used when the sample size is small (\\( n < 30 \\)) and/or the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "   - z-test: Used for larger samples (\\( n \\geq 30 \\)) when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Distribution:\n",
    "   - t-test: Based on the t-distribution, which has thicker tails, making it more appropriate for small samples.\n",
    "   - z-test: Based on the normal distribution, assuming a large enough sample for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Application**:\n",
    "   - **t-test**: More flexible, as it can handle cases where the population standard deviation is unknown, using the sample standard deviation instead.\n",
    "   - **z-test**: Used when the population variance is known and the sample size is sufficiently large to assume normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **t-test Example**: A researcher wants to compare the mean test scores of two small groups of students (e.g., \\( n = 20 \\) each) to \n",
    "determine if there s a significant difference between them. The population standard deviation is unknown, so a t-test is appropriate."
