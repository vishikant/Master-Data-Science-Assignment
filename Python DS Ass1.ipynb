    "#who developed Python programming language in 100 word?\n",
    "Python was developed by **Guido van Rossum**, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s, and it was first released in 1991. Van Rossum \n",
    "created Python as a successor to the ABC programming language, aiming to design a language that was easy to read, write, and understand. \n",
    "His goal was to create a high-level, versatile language that emphasized code readability and simplicity, with a clean syntax. Python has \n",
    "since grown into one of the most popular programming languages, widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation,\n",

    "#Which type of programming python upports?\n",
    "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, making it a highly versatile language:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Python allows users to define classes and objects, supporting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "2. **Procedural Programming**: Python supports writing functions and procedures that operate on data, focusing on step-by-step instructions.\n",
    "3. **Functional Programming**: Python enables functional programming through features like higher-order functions, lambdas, and map-reduce capabilities, supporting immutability and stateless functions.\n",
    "4. **Scripting**: Python can be used for scripting tasks such as automation, file manipulation, and quick programming tasks.\n",
