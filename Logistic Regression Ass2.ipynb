    "### What is Data Leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data leakage** occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. This information might not be available in real-world scenarios where the model is deployed, making the model's performance on new, unseen data much worse than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Data Leakage a Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overestimation of Model Performance**: Data leakage makes the model appear to perform better during training and validation than it will in reality. This can lead to selecting a model that doesn't generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Misleading Insights**: If a model is used to make decisions, leakage can lead to incorrect conclusions or actions, as the model is essentially cheating by using future or unintended data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lack of Generalization**: Models with data leakage often fail to generalize to new, unseen data because they rely on information that won't be available in a real-world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine youre building a model to predict whether a loan applicant will default on a loan. You include a feature in your training data that indicates whether the loan was repaid or defaulted. This feature would be a perfect predictor since it's the exact outcome you're trying to predict, but it’s a form of data leakage because the model learns from the actual future outcome, which wouldn’t be known when making predictions.\n",

    "#Preventing data leakage is crucial for ensuring that your machine learning model performs well on unseen data. Here are key strategies to avoid data leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proper Data Splitting**:\n",
    "   - **Train-Test Split**: Always split your dataset into training and testing sets before any preprocessing. This ensures that information from the test set doesn’t influence model training.\n",
    "   - **Time-Based Splitting**: For time-series data, ensure that the training data only includes information available up to the prediction point, and future data isn’t included.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - **Exclude Post-Event Features**: Avoid using features that contain information that would only be available after the event you are predicting, such as using “loan approval status” when predicting loan defaults.\n",
    "   - **Domain Knowledge**: Use domain knowledge to carefully select features that are relevant and available at the time of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pipeline Integration**:\n",
    "   - **Use Pipelines**: When performing preprocessing steps like scaling, encoding, or feature selection, use pipelines to ensure that these steps are applied only to the training data and then consistently applied to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation Awareness**:\n",
    "   - **In-Sample Data Leakage**: Ensure that cross-validation folds are properly split, with no overlap of data between training and validation sets.\n",
