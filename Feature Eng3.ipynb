    "### **Q1. Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding:**\n",
    "- Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category in a categorical variable without assuming any order. \n",
    "- This method is typically used when the categorical variable does not have an intrinsic order.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding, on the other hand, assigns integers based on the order of the categories. The order is meaningful and reflects the rank of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** For a column with \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Green\", label encoding would assign arbitrary integers like 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding:** For a column with \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\", ordinal encoding would assign 0, 1, and 2, respectively, where the order represents increasing levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing Between the Two:**\n",
    "- You would choose **Label Encoding** when the categorical variable has no natural order (e.g., \"Country\" or \"Color\").\n",
    "- You would choose **Ordinal Encoding** when the variable has a natural order (e.g., \"Education Level\" or \"Customer Satisfaction\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding involves ordering categories of a variable based on their relationship to the target variable. This method is especially useful in classification tasks where the encoding is driven by statistical properties of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each category of the feature.\n",
    "2. Sort the categories based on these aggregated values.\n",
    "3. Assign integers based on the ranking of these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- If you are predicting customer churn, and you have a variable \"City\" with categories \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", you could calculate the average churn rate for each city, and then encode them in increasing order of churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "This technique is useful when you have a categorical variable where the ordering can help improve model performance. For example, in marketing, you could order customer segments based on their average purchase amounts and encode them accordingly.\n",

    "### **Q3. Covariance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables. A positive covariance means that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that when one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "Covariance between variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is calculated as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n - 1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are individual data points, \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) are the means, and \\(n\\) is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis as it helps to understand the relationship between variables, which is crucial in multivariate data analysis. It's often used as a precursor to calculating correlation, which normalizes covariance.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the variables: `Color` (red, green, blue), `Size` (small, medium, large), and `Material` (wood, metal, plastic), here is how you would use Python's scikit-learn to perform label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "- **Cov(Age, Income)** = 362500, a large positive value indicates a strong positive linear relationship between age and income.\n",
    "- **Cov(Age, Education Level)** = 0.5, suggests that there is little linear relationship between age and education level.\n",
